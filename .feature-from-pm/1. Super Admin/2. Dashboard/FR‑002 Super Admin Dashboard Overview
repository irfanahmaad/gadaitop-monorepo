FR‑002 Super Admin Dashboard Overview
Feature Name: Super Admin Dashboard

Description:
The system provides a Dashboard page as the default landing screen after Super Admin login, summarizing SPK and NKB performance, pawn trends, and today’s due SPK list for selected PT, branch, and date.

Actor:

Super Admin (Owner)

Super Admin
​

Priority: High

Preconditions
User is authenticated as Super Admin Owner or Super Admin.
​

At least one PT and branch exist and are accessible to this user.
​

SPK and NKB transactional data exist for the selected PT/branch (or empty states are handled).
​

Postconditions
Dashboard widgets reflect aggregated, read‑only data for the currently selected PT, branch, and date.
​

No modification of underlying SPK/NKB data occurs from this page; navigation links can lead to detailed modules.
​

UI Layout & Filters
The left sidebar shows the Gadai Top logo and menu with at least: Dashboard, Master Super Admin, Master PT, Master Tipe Barang. “Dashboard” is highlighted as the current page.

At the top of the main content, the Dashboard header shows:

Page title “Dashboard” and breadcrumb “Pages / Dashboard”.

Three filter controls aligned to the right:

PT selector (dropdown list of PT Gadai Top entities).

Branch selector (dropdown list of branches for selected PT).

Date selector (single date, default to today).

Changing PT, branch, or date refreshes all widgets below with the new context, without full page reload.

KPI Summary Cards
Directly under the header, four KPI cards are displayed in a row:

“SPK Jatuh Tempo & Overdue” quick count (e.g., number due today/tomorrow/overdue).

“SPK Jatuh Tempo < 1 Bulan” (or similar) as indicated by the sticky note (exact label can be finalized).

“Total Gadai Aktif” count.

“SPK Sisa Hari” or other business KPI per RS and design note.

Each card shows:

A title.

A numeric value.

Optional colored indicator or icon (green/orange/red) matching the Figma style.

Cards update instantly when filters change; if data is not available, they show zero or “–” instead of breaking the layout.

Widget: SPK Jatuh Tempo & Overdue (Chart)
Description:
Bar (or horizontal bar) chart showing counts of SPK in different status segments (On Time, Due Today, Overdue < X days, Overdue ≥ X days) for the selected PT/branch/date.

Acceptance Criteria:

The widget is labeled “SPK Jatuh Tempo & Overdue” and displays a bar chart with a legend for each SPK status segment.

Chart data is aggregated from SPK records based on due date vs selected date and their status flags as defined in RS (Lunas, Berjalan, Terlambat, etc.).
​

Hovering a bar shows a tooltip with the exact count and label.

When no SPK exist for the period, the chart shows an empty state (e.g., blank axes with “No data for selected period”).

Widget: Tren Barang Gadai (Chart)
Description:
Line chart showing trends of pawned items (e.g., count or value) across categories or time buckets.

Acceptance Criteria:

The widget titled “Tren Barang Gadai” displays a line chart with horizontal axis (e.g., time or item type) and vertical axis (e.g., total SPK or amount).

Each plotted point corresponds to aggregated data from SPK for the selected PT/branch/date range; axis semantics must be defined in implementation but follow the Figma pattern.

Hovering a point shows tooltip with label and numeric value.

If no data is available, the widget shows an empty-state message instead of a broken chart.

Widget: SPK Baru (Table)
Description:
Table listing the most recent SPK created within the selected date (or recent period) for the chosen PT and branch.

Acceptance Criteria:

The “SPK Baru” panel shows a compact table with columns:

Nomor SPK

Nominal Gadai

Nama Customer
​

Rows are ordered by creation date/time descending (latest first).

Clicking on a Nomor SPK opens the detailed SPK page in a new view or route (to be defined in SPK module FR).
​

If there are no new SPK for the selected date, the table shows an empty-state message (e.g., “No new SPK today”).

The number of rows is limited (e.g., top 5–10 SPK) as in Figma; full list is accessible via separate SPK module.

Widget: NKB Baru (Table)
Description:
Table listing the most recent NKB (payment) records for the selected PT, branch, and date, including payment type and current SPK status.

Acceptance Criteria:

The “NKB Baru” panel shows columns:

Nomor NKB

Nominal Dibayar

Jenis (payment type: Pelunasan / Perpanjangan)

Status (e.g., Lunas, Berjalan, Terlambat) with colored badges per status.

Rows are ordered by payment date/time descending.

Clicking a Nomor NKB opens detailed payment information in the NKB module.
​

Status badges (e.g., green for Lunas, blue for Berjalan, red for Terlambat) visually match the Figma design.
​

Empty state is handled similarly to SPK Baru when no NKB exist for the selected criteria.

Widget: Daftar SPK Jatuh Tempo Hari Ini (Table)
Description:
Table listing SPK that are due on the selected date (typically “today”) for the chosen PT and branch.

Acceptance Criteria:

The “Daftar SPK Jatuh Tempo Hari Ini” table shows columns:

No (row number)

Nomor SPK

Nama Customer

Jumlah SPK (or amount / count field as per design)

Sisa SPK (remaining principal)

Tanggal & Waktu SPK or due date/time.

Data is filtered to SPK whose due date equals the selected date and whose status is not yet Lunas or Lelang.
​

Rows are sorted by due time ascending (earliest due first).

If there are no SPK due today for this PT/branch, an empty state is shown.

Clicking on Nomor SPK navigates to the detailed SPK view.
​

General Dashboard Behavior
All widgets reload coherently when PT, branch, or date changes; while loading, a skeleton or spinner is shown per widget to avoid flicker.

All data on this page is read‑only; no inline editing or destructive actions are available here.
​

The Dashboard respects security constraints: only data belonging to PT/branch that the Super Admin is allowed to see is loaded.
​

Layout remains stable on standard desktop resolutions; if horizontal overflow occurs, internal scrollbars are used within tables rather than breaking outer layout.
