FR‑181 View “Mata” Terms List
Feature Name: View Item Loan Terms (“Mata”)

Description: The system displays a list of loan-condition records (“Syarat Mata”) linked to catalog items.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: High

Acceptance Criteria:

The “Master Syarat ‘Mata’” page shows a table with columns such as Item Name, Item Type, Maximum Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Penalty Rate, and Last Updated Date, matching the design.

The list is paginated and supports search by item name; a filter panel allows filtering by Last Updated date range and maximum amount range.

Each row is linked to a specific catalog item so that one catalog item can have one or more defined term records as required by business rules.
​

FR‑182 Create New “Mata” Term
Feature Name: Create Item Loan Term

Description: Admin PT can define new loan terms (“Syarat Mata”) for a catalog item.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: High

Acceptance Criteria:

The “Tambah Data” form includes fields such as Catalog Item, Item Type (auto or selectable), Minimum and Maximum Loan Amount, Interest Rate, Penalty Rate (per period), Loan Tenor, and Description/Notes.

Required fields are validated; interest/penalty percentages must be within configured bounds and comply with regulatory caps where applicable.
​

On successful save, a confirmation dialog appears and the new term record shows in the Master Syarat “Mata” list for that catalog item.

FR‑183 View “Mata” Term Detail
Feature Name: View “Mata” Detail

Description: Admin PT can open a detailed view of loan conditions for a specific catalog item.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: Medium

Acceptance Criteria:

The detail view displays all configured parameters, including item name, item type, maximum loan amount, base appraisal percentage (loan-to-value), interest rate, penalty rate, and any special conditions (e.g., grace days, promo flags).

The screen is read-only until Edit is selected, providing a reference for pricing and risk policies used when appraising collateral and generating SPK.
​

Branch and SPK modules read these values as defaults when the related catalog item is selected.

FR‑184 Edit “Mata” Terms
Feature Name: Edit Item Loan Terms

Description: Admin PT can modify existing “Syarat Mata” records when pricing or regulatory conditions change.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: Medium

Acceptance Criteria:

From the list or detail view, an Edit action opens a form pre-filled with current term values; Admin PT can change numeric values and notes while catalog item linkage may be fixed according to rules.

Saving changes triggers a confirmation dialog; after confirmation the term record is updated, Last Updated Date is refreshed, and success feedback is shown.
​

Historical SPK already issued under previous terms remain unchanged; updated terms only apply to new contracts created after the change.

FR‑185 Bulk Manage “Mata” Terms (Optional)
Feature Name: Bulk Update/Selection of “Mata”

Description: Admin PT can select multiple “Mata” records for actions such as bulk activation/deactivation or deletion if allowed.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: Low/Optional

Acceptance Criteria:

The list allows multi-select via checkboxes; bulk actions (e.g., Activate, Deactivate, Delete) appear when two or more rows are selected.

Executing a bulk action shows a confirmation dialog summarizing how many records will be affected; on success, the status of each selected term is updated accordingly and an overall success message is displayed.
​

Deactivation prevents a term from being used for new SPK but preserves it for audit; deletion may be restricted to terms that have never been used.
