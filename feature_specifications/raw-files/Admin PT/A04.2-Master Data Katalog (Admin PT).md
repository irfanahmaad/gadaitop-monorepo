FR‑176 View Catalog Master List
Feature Name: View Catalog List

Description: The system displays a list of catalog items that represent standard products (e.g., iPhone models, laptops, motorcycles) used across branches.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: High

Acceptance Criteria:

The “Master Katalog” page shows a table with columns such as Catalog Code, Catalog Name, Item Type, Base Price/Value, and Last Updated Date, matching the design.

The list is paginated and supports search by catalog name or code; Admin PT sees only catalog records belonging to their PT or global scope as defined.

A filter panel allows filtering by Last Updated date range, minimum and maximum price, and item type; applying filters refreshes the table while Reset restores defaults.
​

FR‑177 Create New Catalog Item
Feature Name: Create Catalog Item

Description: Admin PT can create a new catalog entry that defines a standard item, including price guidance and pawn parameters.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: High

Acceptance Criteria:

The “Tambah Data” form includes fields such as Catalog Name, Item Type, Base Price, Pawn Value Range (minimum/maximum), Number of Installments, and Description, along with an optional image upload.

Required fields are validated; catalog names or codes that must be unique are checked and rejected with clear error messages when duplicated.
​

On successful save, a confirmation dialog appears and the new catalog item becomes visible in the catalog list.

FR‑178 View Catalog Item Detail
Feature Name: View Catalog Detail

Description: Admin PT can open a detail page for a catalog item showing all configuration values.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: Medium

Acceptance Criteria:

The detail view shows data such as item image, catalog code, catalog name, item type, base price, pawn price range, number of installments, and description, matching the design layout.

Data is read-only until Edit is selected, providing a clear reference for branch users and other modules (e.g., SPK creation).
​

From this screen Admin PT can navigate back to the catalog list or proceed to edit the item.

FR‑179 Edit Catalog Item
Feature Name: Edit Catalog Item

Description: Admin PT can update catalog attributes when prices or configurations change.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: Medium

Acceptance Criteria:

Selecting Edit on a catalog detail page opens a form pre-filled with the current values, including the ability to change item image, prices, and pawn parameters.

Saving updates requires confirmation and then writes changes to the catalog record; Last Updated Date is refreshed and success dialogs are shown.
​

Changes in catalog price guidance are used by downstream processes (e.g., SPK valuation) from that point forward but do not retroactively alter existing contracts.

FR‑180 Import Catalog Data (Optional)
Feature Name: Import Catalog Items

Description: Admin PT can bulk-import catalog entries from an external file to speed up setup and maintenance.

Actor: Admin PT

Priority: Low/Optional

Acceptance Criteria:

An “Import Data” button allows uploading a file (e.g., CSV/Excel) that contains catalog attributes; the system validates required columns and shows errors for any invalid rows.

Valid rows are inserted or updated according to defined matching rules (e.g., by catalog code), and a summary of imported/failed records is displayed.
​
​

Only users with appropriate permissions can use Import; large imports are processed asynchronously if necessary, with status feedback to the Admin PT.

## Data Scoping & Multi-Tenancy (Admin PT)

Acceptance Criteria:
- All data queries **must** be securely filtered by the logged-in Admin PT's `ptId` (company UUID) to prevent cross-tenant data leakage.
- Where a branch selector/context is applicable, an optional **branch filter (`storeId` or `branchId`)** further narrows results to the selected subset.
- Backend API endpoints must enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and strictly reject any requests attempting to read or mutate data outside the Admin PT's authorized PT scope.
