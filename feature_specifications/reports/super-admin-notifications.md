FR‑064 View Notification List
Feature Name: View Notification List

Description: The system displays a list of notifications generated by the application, in a paginated table.

Actor: Super Admin (Owner), Super Admin

Priority: High

Acceptance Criteria:

The Notifications page shows a table with columns: No, Notification Name, Description, and Date & Time, matching the design.

Each row represents one notification stored in the system, ordered by date & time (newest first, unless another default is agreed).
​

The list is read‑only; there are no row‑level edit/delete actions on this screen.

FR‑065 Notification Pagination
Feature Name: Notification List Pagination

Description: The system provides pagination controls to navigate through the notification history.

Actor: Super Admin (Owner), Super Admin

Priority: Medium

Acceptance Criteria:

Users can change the number of notifications per page using the dropdown at the top (e.g., 10, 25, 100).

“Previous”, “Next”, and page number controls allow navigation across pages; the visible rows and page indicator update correctly.
​

The footer text “Showing X–Y of Z results” always displays the correct range and total number of notifications.

FR‑066 Search Notifications
Feature Name: Search Notifications

Description: The system provides a search input to filter notifications by keyword (for example, notification name or email text, according to configuration).

Actor: Super Admin (Owner), Super Admin

Priority: High

Acceptance Criteria:

Entering a keyword and pressing Enter or clicking the search icon filters the list to only notifications that match the configured fields.
​

If no notifications match the search term, an empty state message is displayed instead of an error.

Pagination works together with search so that moving between pages preserves the active search filter.

FR‑067 Filter Notifications
Feature Name: Filter Notifications

Description: The system provides a Filter button that opens filter options (for example, by date range, type, or status) to refine the notification list.

Actor: Super Admin (Owner), Super Admin

Priority: Medium

Acceptance Criteria:

Clicking the “Filter” button opens a filter panel or dialog with at least one filter criterion (e.g., date range); applying filters updates the list accordingly.
​

Active filters are clearly indicated (for example, with chips or summary text) and can be cleared to return to the full list.

Pagination honors active filters so that navigating pages does not reset the selected filter set.

FR‑068 Navigate Back from Notifications
Feature Name: Back from Notifications

Description: The system provides a Back button on the Notifications page to return to the previous CMS screen.

Actor: Super Admin (Owner), Super Admin

Priority: Low

Acceptance Criteria:

Clicking the “Back” button returns the user to the previous page (e.g., Dashboard), using either browser history or a defined target route.

The Back button is always visible at the top‑right area of the Notifications page as indicated in the design.

Returning via Back does not break the user’s session or lose unsaved data on the previous screen (if applicable).
